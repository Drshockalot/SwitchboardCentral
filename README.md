Database Assignment

PROGRESS: LATEST NEWS AT TOP
===============
To my knowledge and understanding, the data has been loaded correctly. I checked a few things and it seems to be maching up correctly, but I have not tested it very thoroughly. If you guys could do some querying on it to see if it comes up with the right information then it should be fine. The next task will be to get all of the constraints in now so that they are playing together nicely.
