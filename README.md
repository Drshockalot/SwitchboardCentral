Database Assignment

PROGRESS: LATEST NEWS AT TOP
===============
The base constraints are now implemented into the tables of the database, I had to go through and modify a couple fields of the EQUIPMENTALLOCATION table, just because of some misspelt data that didn't get caught in the update statement, which resulted in the EQUIPMENTID field being left blank. Apart from that, any non essential constraints still need to be put in (NOT NULL etc), the data types of each field needs to be looked over and set to something sensible as well. The data dictionary needs to be updated with the new data structure that I made, but I am looking to make a couple more changes over the next couple days so that might not be worth doing yet. I gave you guys permissions on the new set of tables.

To my knowledge and understanding, the data has been loaded correctly. I checked a few things and it seems to be maching up correctly, but I have not tested it very thoroughly. If you guys could do some querying on it to see if it comes up with the right information then it should be fine. The next task will be to get all of the constraints in now so that they are playing together nicely.

The vast majority of the data is loaded into the database now, just panning out what he wants exactly for the assessment criteria, the full data will be loaded within a day or two of this post.
